Proof of concept of using a phone as a gamepad for a game on PC or TV.

```bash
    $ npm install -d
    $ node ./server.js
```
Go to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080 with your desktop browser (which will display
gamepad touches) and go to the same address with your smartphone (which will
be the gamepad).
